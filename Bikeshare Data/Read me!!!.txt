### 📋 Things to Know About the Dataset

- **🗂️ Monthly Datasets:**  
  - The datasets are provided on a monthly basis. I combined them into one large dataset.

- **⚠️ Column Inconsistencies:**  
  - For the first 2 years (up to March 2020), there are inconsistencies in the columns.  
  - **Note:** Some columns present in 2019 to March 2020 are missing in data after March 2020.

- **🚫 Missing Data:**  
  - Data for **April 2020** is not available on the website and was skipped.

- **🧹 Data Cleaning:**  
  - I cleaned the data and resolved the column inconsistencies before merging all datasets together.

- **💾 File Size:**  
  - The final combined file is **3.12 GB**.

- **📦 GitHub & Git LFS:**  
  - GitHub does not allow large files to be uploaded directly, so I used **Git LFS** to manage the dataset.  
  - **Tip:** If you're not familiar with Git LFS, check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ln6iRh_LTo&t=174s) for a clear explanation.

- **🛠️ Splitting Files:**  
  - Even with Git LFS, users cannot upload datasets larger than 2GB in one go.  
  - I had to break the dataset into 2 parts. **Make sure to download both and merge them before proceeding.**

### 🔍 Data Cleaning Steps Performed

- **❌ Inconsistent Data (2018 - Mar 2020):**  
  - Columns in data from 2018 to March 2020 didn't align with data from later months.  
  - **Action:** Renamed some columns and dropped others to standardize the data.

- **🚫 Skipped Data:**  
  - Data for **April 2020** is missing on the website, so it was omitted.

- **📝 Adding Missing Columns:**  
  - For the period 2018 to March 2020, a few columns were missing.  
  - **Action:** Added those columns with `NA` values to ensure consistency.

- **🔗 Final Merge:**  
  - All the cleaned files were merged into one final dataset, which is around **3GB** in size and ready for analysis.
