It is too large to upload on Github.
There are few data cleaning steps which need to be performed before the final dataset can be used. 

They are:

1. Data from 2018 to March 2020 is not in line with the data after March 2020. Columns need to be renamed and a few columns need to be dropped. 
2. Data for April 2020 is not available on the website. So it must be skipped. 
3. There are a couple of columns which need to be added to the data between 2018 to March 2020 with NA values since the coloumns do not explicitly exist in the data 
   for those months. 
4. All the files need to be merged together and then used for analysis. Size of the final dataset is around 3GB
